Design Philosophy Principles

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
• Solutions must be straightforward and easy to understand.
• Avoid over-engineering or unnecessary abstraction.
• Prioritise code readability and maintainability.

YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
• Do not add speculative features or future-proofing unless explicitly required.
• Focus only on immediate requirements and deliverables.
• Minimise code bloat and long-term technical debt.

SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility Principle: each module or function should do one thing only.
Open-Closed Principle: software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle: derived classes must be substitutable for their base types.
Interface Segregation Principle: prefer many specific interfaces over one general-purpose interface.
Dependency Inversion Principle: depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
